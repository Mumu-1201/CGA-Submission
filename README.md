The attached Input_DICOM_0_50_0 file is the input 3D image porous medium.  
The attached Output_Result file is the tetrahedral mesh of 3D image porous medium generated by the CDT algorithm, the file requires the paraview software to view it, but as this software only supports viewing the surface mesh, if you need to view the volume mesh, you can see it in the video in Experiment & Result.
